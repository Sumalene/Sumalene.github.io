Hello everyone, I am a student from the class of 2026 majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology. Like many of my classmates, I went through the process of job preparation from confusion to gradually gaining clarity during my junior year. Looking back, this journey was not easy, but I also accumulated some experiences that may be helpful to everyone.

I would like to share them briefly here and also express my gratitude to the school for the support provided in career guidance.

## Ⅰ. My experience:

In my sophomore year, I joined the college's  AIoT laboratory, where I did some projects with my classmates and participated in IoT-related competitions.
This experience allowed me to experience the warmth of teamwork and at the same time come into contact with real technical implementation problems.

In addition to the Internet of Things competition in 2024, I also participated in the national competition of mathematical modeling and was honored to win the national award. 
That experience allowed me to meet other outstanding classmates and teammates, and I also realized the importance of continuous learning and communication.

I then had an autumn internship at BOC, mainly responsible for data analysis, which gave me a more practical understanding of workplace collaboration and real society. 

The internship is not easy, and The educational requirements for becoming a permanent employee are also very high. so my friends and I chose to prepare for the Graduate Entrance Examination, of course, the school also supports the GEEer very much.

Since September last year, autumn school recruitment has begun. Maybe it's self-pressure, I chose to prepare for work at the same time (of course, I don't regret it), while reviewing 408, I picked up the Internet and algorithms again, and tried to package my previous internship and project experience, Practicing problems on LeetCode to prepare.

From October to the end of November, I concentrated on submitting my resume, interviewed Lenovo, Meituan, Xiaomi Kuaishou and other companies, received offers from small companies, and also experienced resumes being hung up and failed interviews. 

But after each time, I will briefly review and adjust the direction of expression and preparation. 

In the end, I signed with Beyond Auto in December, which also brought an end to the Graduate Entrance Examination.

## Ⅱ. Specific suggestions based on personal experience:

**1. Delivery strategy:  mass-applying + accurate review**

...If your educational background is average or you want to gain more interview experience, it's recommended to start mass-applying early (the earlier, the better). You don't have to focus only on big companies; small and medium-sized companies can also serve as practice and backup options.
There is no need to focus only on large factories, small and medium-sized factories can also be used as training and alternatives.

**Mock interviews** are important: you can ask yourself questions and answer questions in front of the camera and adapt to the rhythm.

**Review after the interview:** Which questions were not answered well? Is the expression clear? Constantly adjust.

**2. About the project and resume**
 
Don't ask for too many projects, but seek clarity: the course design and laboratory projects you have done can be sorted out in dep.
Write specific skills: For example, not only write "familiar with Python", but also explain commonly used libraries, frameworks, or practical application scenarios.
Award abbreviation and focus: There are awards with gold content to write, but they do not need to be expanded, keep it concise.

**3. Delivery channels: active display, multi-channel parallel**

**Direct recruitment software**: Don't just say "hello" when greeting, you can briefly explain your strengths.

**Company official website**: The company recommends direct delivery to the official website, and the information is more timely.

**School Career Fair**: This is a very important channel! When enterprises come to the school to give lectures, the process is often faster, and they can even go directly to the interview, so it is recommended that everyone actively pay attention and actively participate.

## Ⅲ. Finally

I would like to say to you:

Anxiety is inevitable on the road to job hunting, and there will also be moments of failure and self-doubt. I have experienced the anxiety of having my resume hung up, being speechless in interviews, and waiting for an offer. 

But looking back, every attempt and review is pushing you forward. 

Don't be overly frivolous about success or failure, 

**don't regret the choices you've made**, and **Contentment brings happiness**.

**Tread on the summit, gaze upward where greater peaks remain.**
